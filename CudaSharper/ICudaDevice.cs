/*
 * CudaSharper - a wrapper for CUDA-accelerated functions. CudaSharper is not intended to write CUDA in C#, but rather a
 * library that allows one to easily use CUDA-accelerated functions without having to directly interact with the device.
 * This file acts as a wrapper for CudaSharperLibrary.dll, which is required for these functions to run. CudaSharperLibrary.dll
 * is the actual CUDA C code compiled as a C++/CLI assembly; however, it is unmanaged and therefore requires this wrapper to be used
 * in C# projects.
 * 
 * Current Classes:
 * - CudaSettings: Initialization class.
 * - Cuda: Array functions, such as SplitArray and AddArrays
 * - CuRand: cuRAND functions; allows the generation of pseudorandom number sets using uniform, normal, or poisson distributions.
